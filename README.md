# Type Race
A React web page that tracks how long it takes the user to type a selected text snippet. The user can choose between snippets of three categories: movie titles, random quotes, and quotes from Kanye West. The app randomly selects three snippets for each category subsequently allowing the user to receive a new batch upon refreshing the web page.

### Technologies Used
* React.js
* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5
* CSS3
* ~~Semantic UI~~ (replaced with custom CSS)

### Future improvements
- Improved error handling on rejected API call
- Caching and / or static fallback data for failed and faster loads
- Abstract component logic into controllers where applicable
- Write some unit tests
- Update UI/UX to better communicate workflow and how to play
